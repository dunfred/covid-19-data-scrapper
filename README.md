When running this script on a windows OS, Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and download a windows version of chromedriver and replace with the one you have in this directory then run the script.
Linux users don't have to download anything just run the script.

Note: For Windows users only please remember to add .exe to chromedriver path name in python script as well.
==> From  "./chromedriver" to  "./chromedriver.exe"

Thank You
